# Difference between = and == operators:

x = 10
# Assignment in Python


#equality comparison.
y = 5
z = 5
result = (y == z)
print(result)


#** operator:

a = 2
b = 3
result = a ** b  # This will be 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
print(result)


# ^ operator:

x = 5  # binary: 0101
y = 3  # binary: 0011
result = x ^ y  # This will be 6 (binary: 0110)
