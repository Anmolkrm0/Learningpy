The desired tone should be both casual and informal. To clarify:
- 'Casual' means writing as if you're talking to a friend or someone of the same age in a light-hearted, relaxed, and easy-going tone. Feel free to use contractions, colloquialisms, and idioms.
- 'Informal' means using everyday and conversational language. Avoid complex structures and technical terms or jargon unless it's widely understood. Shorten sentences where possible.

Choose the appropriate degree of casualness and informality in your tone to align with the subject and goal of the text.

Write the text like a real person would. Keep the meaning the same. If possible, retain the structure of the paragraphs. Ensure the re-written text's word count is near to the original text.

Output the answer without additional context, explanation, or extra wording, just the rewritten text itself. Don't use any punctuation, especially no quotes or backticks, around the text.
